## Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to install PGR2Modded:
1. **Select a Pack**: Choose either the KPack or Proto Pack based on your preference. Each pack is independent and cannot be used simultaneously.
2. **Copy Game Files**: Copy the files from your chosen pack to the corresponding locations on your console, overwriting the existing *Project Gotham Racing 2* game files.
3. **Clear Cache**: Clear your game cache to prevent a "dirty disk" error on the first load. If the error occurs, the cache will be force-cleared, and the game will load correctly on the next attempt.
4. **Use JayFNG Profile**: To access unlocked tracks, use the JayFNG profile. You may need to purchase cars using in-game tokens.
5. **Important**: Do **not** install the `FutureFixes` folder, as it is not compatible with the current mod version.

## Important Notes
- **Language Support**: This mod currently supports only English systems. Multi-language support is planned for future updates.
- **Online Scoreboards**: **Do not** upload scores to online leaderboards using modded cars or tracks, as this may result in a ban.
- **Work in Progress**: PGR2Modded is under active development, and some features may be refined or expanded in future releases.
- **BUG**: The F1 car does not load in the model in offline mode. To drive the F1 car you must first click into another car class then back out and then click the Proto Pack and select the F1 . You MUST do this every time you want to race it or scroll past its option in the menu. It will freeze your game otherwise. Working on a solution…
