DO NOT UPLOAD SCORES TO ANY SCOREBOARDS ONLINE USING THESE CARS OR YOU WILL BE BANNED.

How to install:

Copy the game files over the top of your current game files and clear your cache. Run the game.

If you do not clear your cache , you will get a dirty disk error on the first load of the game if you try to load any new car. It will force clear cache at that point and the next load will load the game properly. This only applies after install.

DO NOT INSTALL THE FutureFixes Folder.

To unlock the tracks you MUST use the JayFNG profile. You may need to buy the cars with tokens.
